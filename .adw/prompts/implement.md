## Switchyard ADW project context

<!-- Generated project context. Edit .adw/pack.profile.json and run `npm run pack:generate`; do not hand-edit this block in .adw/prompts. -->

### Repository context to read

- `README.md` at the repository root, if present, for top-level project context.
- `adw_sdlc/README.md` — package overview, commands, config surface, and documentation map.
- `adw_sdlc/HANDOVER.md` — current architecture, operational invariants, and session-to-session state.
- `adw_sdlc/MVP-READINESS.md` and `adw_sdlc/PARITY.md` — MVP gates, live-run evidence, and parity criteria.
- `adw_sdlc/docs/LIVE-RUN-BATCH.md` — planned live `claude` issues and run-command templates.
- The specific GitHub issue being worked (`kortiene/switchyard`) and its acceptance criteria.
- The existing source tree and tests as they actually exist now; verify before assuming behavior.

### Project summary

`Switchyard` contains the ADW SDLC TypeScript control plane and related project-pack / Pi cockpit tooling. The control plane drives one work item through deterministic phases (`setup → classify → plan → implement → tests → resolve → e2e → review → patch → document → finalize → ci-fix → merge → report`) while runner adapters (`claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `pi`) perform only the agentic code-editing phases. The near-term MVP goal is audited live reliability for the `claude` runner.

### Component map

- `adw_sdlc/src/orchestrator.ts`, `run-phase.ts`, `phases.ts`, `state.ts` — deterministic phase control, prompt composition, structured-output handling, and persisted run state.
- `adw_sdlc/src/runners/` and `invoker.ts` — runner adapters and the shared `AgentRunner.runPhase()` seam.
- `adw_sdlc/src/env.ts`, `env-vars.ts`, `exec.ts` — secret-boundary env allowlist, canonical `ADW_*` control-plane env aliases, and subprocess helpers.
- `adw_sdlc/src/providers*.ts`, `provider-descriptor.ts` — GitHub/git built-ins plus declarative `cli`/`rest` provider support.
- `adw_sdlc/tools/` — prompt-pack generation and parity-rate measurement.
- `.adw/config.json`, `.adw/pack.profile.json`, `.adw/prompts/` — project pack and generated runtime prompt templates.
- `.pi/extensions/adw-cockpit/` and `adw_sdlc/docs/PI-UI-EXTENSION-BACKLOG.md` — optional Pi TUI cockpit surface.

### Security and operational invariants

- The orchestrator owns all git/gh operations; ADW phases must not ask the coding agent to run git or gh.
- Runner child environments are deny-by-default: `GH_TOKEN`, `MATRIX_*`, canonical `ADW_*`, and legacy `MX_AGENT_*` control variables must not reach agents.
- Do not spread `process.env` into runner processes; `npm run lint:env` guards this boundary.
- Opencode integration must use the approved v2 client path and avoid factory calls that inherit parent env.
- Treat `PHASE_PREAMBLE_SHARED` and prompt contract wording as behavior-affecting; change only with explicit care and tests.
- State-schema fields used for cross-language compatibility must remain additive/non-breaking.

### Current status and assumptions

The package is TypeScript/Node and uses npm. Canonical runtime env knobs use `ADW_*` names, with deprecated `MX_AGENT_*` compatibility aliases. The canonical local gate is `npm run verify`, which runs typecheck, env lint, prompt-pack drift check, tests, build, and removes `dist/`. A live-run issue batch (#1–#8) exists to collect MVP evidence, but do not start costly live `claude` runs unless explicitly asked.

### Working rules

- Keep changes scoped to the GitHub issue and acceptance criteria.
- Prefer small, auditable changes with focused tests over broad rewrites.
- Update docs and prompt-pack sources when behavior or operator guidance changes.
- If `.adw/pack.profile.json` changes, regenerate `.adw/prompts` with `npm run pack:generate` and verify with `npm run pack:check`.
- Use `ADW_TEST_CMD="npm run verify"` for live ADW runs; do not chain multiple commands directly in `ADW_TEST_CMD`.

### Verification guidance

Run the most relevant focused test(s) for your change first — e.g. `npx vitest run test/<file>.test.ts` from `adw_sdlc/`. Reserve the full `npm run verify` gate (typecheck, env lint, prompt-pack drift, tests, build) for broad or risky changes and for the final review; the ADW orchestrator runs the canonical gate at finalize, so re-running the whole suite in every phase wastes time and budget. If a check cannot be run, state exactly why and what command the maintainer should run.

Implement the specification in this file end-to-end:

$1

Extra context/notes from me (may be empty): ${@:2}

Do not stop after planning unless the spec is genuinely ambiguous, unsafe, impossible, or blocked by missing information. Read the spec, implement it, test it, and report the result.

Workflow:

1. Read and understand the spec.
   - Read `$1` completely.
   - Treat the spec as the source of truth for scope and acceptance criteria.
   - If the file does not exist, stop and report the missing path.
   - If the spec is ambiguous, make a safe, explicit assumption when possible and proceed. Stop only for real blockers.

2. Read enough repository context.
   - Identify the owning package/module/service.
   - Inspect relevant existing patterns, tests, config, docs, and contracts.
   - Preserve project-specific security, privacy, compliance, performance, and operational constraints documented in the repo.

3. Implement with production-grade discipline.
   - Keep the change scoped to the spec.
   - Prefer clear, maintainable code over cleverness.
   - Add validation, error handling, and observability where relevant.
   - Avoid unrelated refactors.

4. Verify.
   - Add or update focused tests when appropriate.
   - Run the relevant local checks if discoverable and safe.
   - If checks cannot be run, explain exactly why.

Return a concise implementation report: files changed, behavior implemented, tests/checks run, risks, and follow-ups.
