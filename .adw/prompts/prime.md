## HealthTech project context

<!-- Generated project context. Edit .adw/pack.profile.json and run `npm run pack:generate`; do not hand-edit this block in .adw/prompts. -->

### Repository context to read

- `PRD_HealthTech.md` — product requirements, personas, epics/user stories, security spec, and NFRs.
- `BACKLOG.md` — milestones M0–M4, issues #1–#31, dependency graph, and recommended implementation order.
- The specific GitHub issue being worked (`kortiene/HealthTech`) and its acceptance criteria.
- The existing source tree as it actually exists now. This project began greenfield; do not assume an app, backend, test command, or stack exists until you verify it on disk.

### Product summary

`HealthTech` is a decentralized, local-first / zero-knowledge digital health platform for Côte d'Ivoire, serving patients and health professionals. The patient carries their medical record on their smartphone and grants ephemeral, controlled access to professionals via a dynamic QR code, without depending on permanent internet connectivity. The cloud stores only opaque encrypted blobs keyed by anonymous UUIDs and must never read or decrypt medical data.

### Target component map

- Patient app: mobile-first, Android focus on entry-level devices; local account creation, master-key generation, record encryption, QR generation, zero-knowledge cloud backup, key recovery.
- Health-professional interface: web/PWA + mobile; QR scan, RAM-only decryption, note/prescription editing, end-of-session re-encryption + cloud sync + RAM wipe, offline queue.
- Zero-knowledge backend: minimal blob store (`PUT/GET /blob/{uuid}`), hosted on Ivorian soil; never sees plaintext or keys.
- Shared crypto core: AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption, master-key management, PBKDF2 key derivation/recovery.
- Infra/compliance: sovereign hosting, secrets management, CI/CD, ARTCI homologation artifacts.

### Security and privacy constraints

- Local-first / zero-knowledge is non-negotiable: the medical record is encrypted client-side with AES-256-GCM before any network transit.
- Never weaken cryptography; never log or persist plaintext medical data, encryption keys, or PII.
- Access is ephemeral and patient-controlled: QR codes expire around 120 seconds; professionals decrypt in RAM only; sessions are wiped on end/inactivity.
- Data residency: data must stay hosted on Ivorian soil to satisfy ARTCI / loi n°2013-450.
- Degraded-network resilience: tolerate power/network cuts; support offline queueing; plaintext record stays <= 500 KB; heavy medical images are never stored on the patient device, only ephemeral URLs.
- The master key is generated on-device and sealed in the hardware keystore; it is never exported in clear.

### Current status and assumptions

HealthTech started as a greenfield project. Verify the current state from the repository before acting. If the stack or test command is still unset, do not assume Cargo/Rust, npm, Flutter, backend language, object storage, or CI conventions. Work from the PRD, BACKLOG, and the specific issue.

### Working rules

- Identify the owning component before editing.
- Respect BACKLOG dependency order; crypto core (#10) and zero-knowledge backend (#9) gate much downstream work; the consultation loop (#16→#19) is core demonstrable value.
- Preserve the zero-knowledge boundary and local-first/offline-resilient design in every change.
- Keep changes focused, idiomatic, testable, and production-minded.
- Update relevant docs, ADRs, schemas, threat-model, or compliance artifacts when behavior changes.
- The orchestrator owns all git/gh operations; do not run git or gh yourself inside ADW phases.

### Verification guidance

Run the project's configured test gate when available (`ADW_TEST_CMD`) plus any format/lint/build checks the repo defines. If no test command is configured, state that clearly and recommend the exact command(s) to run once the stack lands; do not invent a toolchain.

Prime yourself for working on this repository before taking action.

Optional task/context from me: $ARGUMENTS

First, read and internalize the repository context:

- README / getting-started docs
- product requirements, backlog, roadmap, ADRs, specs, or architecture docs when present
- contribution, testing, security, deployment, and operational docs
- package/build manifests and workspace structure
- the specific work item or task context, if available
- relevant source files and tests for the requested area

Build a concise working model of:

1. What this project does and who it serves
2. The technology stack and package/module layout
3. Core domain concepts and data flows
4. Security/privacy/compliance constraints documented by the project
5. How to run, test, lint, build, and ship safely
6. Current gaps, risks, or unknowns relevant to the task

Do not make changes during priming unless explicitly asked. End with a brief orientation and the next concrete action you recommend.
