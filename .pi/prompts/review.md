Review this pull request, which may have been produced by `/implement`:

PR: $1
Spec file, if provided: $2
Extra context/notes from me (may be empty): ${@:3}

Do not modify code unless explicitly asked. Focus on review quality, correctness, security, scope control, and actionable feedback. If the PR has actionable issues, comment on the PR when useful.

Workflow:

1. Validate inputs
   - If `$1` is missing, stop and ask for a PR URL or number.
   - If `$2` is provided, read the spec file completely and review the PR against it.
   - If `$2` is provided but missing, report that clearly and continue reviewing against repository context if possible.

2. Read repository context before reviewing
   - `PRD_HealthTech.md` (product requirements: local-first / zero-knowledge architecture, security spec)
   - `BACKLOG.md` (epics, issues, milestone order, and dependencies)
   - the specific GitHub issue the PR addresses, if referenced
   - the application source tree once it exists (the project is greenfield — if no app code exists yet, say so and review against the PRD/backlog and any committed ADRs under `docs/adr/`)
   - changed source files, tests, and docs from the PR

3. Inspect the PR
   - Use `gh` (or `~/.local/bin/gh` if needed) to inspect PR metadata, commits, changed files, checks, and diff.
   - Determine the base branch and compare the PR against the correct base.
   - Read enough of the changed files in context to understand the implementation, not just the diff.

4. Review against the spec and repository constraints
   - Verify whether the PR satisfies the provided spec and acceptance criteria.
   - Check that the implementation does not exceed the requested scope.
   - Confirm docs are updated when behavior changes.
   - Confirm tests cover the new behavior and important edge cases.

5. Check HealthTech-specific requirements
   - Preserve local-first / zero-knowledge: the patient's medical record must be encrypted client-side with AES-256-GCM before any network transit; the server only ever stores opaque encrypted blobs keyed by anonymous UUIDs and must never be able to read or decrypt them.
   - Ensure the cryptography is never weakened; no plaintext medical data, encryption keys, or PII is ever logged or persisted.
   - Ensure access remains ephemeral and patient-controlled: access QR codes expire (~120s); a professional decrypts the record in RAM only and the session is wiped at the end or after inactivity.
   - Verify data residency: data stays hosted on Ivorian soil to satisfy ARTCI / loi n°2013-450.
   - Verify degraded-network resilience: the change works offline (e.g. SQLCipher queue) and tolerates power/network cuts; the plaintext record stays <= 500 KB; heavy medical images are never stored on the patient device (only an ephemeral URL is embedded).
   - Confirm secrets and keys are never logged or posted; use existing redaction patterns.
   - Do not accept misleading status claims or docs implying unimplemented behavior exists.

6. Look for general review issues
   - Correctness bugs or incomplete behavior
   - Missing error handling or poor error messages
   - Race conditions, restart/retry issues, or persistence gaps
   - Security regressions or trust/policy bypasses
   - Protocol/schema compatibility issues
   - Weak tests or missing negative tests
   - Overly broad rewrites or unrelated changes
   - Formatting, lint, or docs-warning risks

7. Verify checks when practical
   - Inspect existing PR/CI check status with `gh`.
   - When practical and appropriate locally, run the project's configured test gate (the command surfaced via `MX_AGENT_TEST_CMD`) plus any format/lint/build checks the project defines.
   - HealthTech has not finalized its stack or test command yet (backlog #1). If no test command is configured, say so explicitly and recommend the exact command to run once the stack lands — do not assume a particular language, build tool, or test runner.
   - If checks cannot be run, explain why and recommend exact commands.

8. Comment on the PR when needed
   - If the PR has actionable issues, post a clear PR review comment or review summary using `gh`.
   - Prefer one consolidated review comment over many noisy comments unless line-specific feedback is important.
   - Comment only when feedback is useful, actionable, and relevant to the PR.
   - Do not post a PR comment for purely local observations unless they affect the PR.
   - If the PR looks good, either approve if appropriate or leave a concise positive summary, depending on available permissions.
   - Never post secrets, tokens, credentials, encryption keys, plaintext medical data, PII, private paths that matter, or sensitive data in PR comments.
   - In the local final report, state exactly what PR comments or reviews were posted, if any.

9. Produce a structured local review report
   - Summary
   - Spec compliance assessment
   - Security assessment
   - Correctness issues
   - Testing/docs gaps
   - Required fixes
   - Optional improvements
   - Checks reviewed or run, with results
   - PR comments posted, if any
   - Final recommendation: approve / request changes / needs more info

Important: do not implement fixes during review unless explicitly asked. Review first; comment on the PR only when it improves the PR outcome.
